        <h1>Devansh Negi</h1>
        

        <p>
            Learning, for me, goes beyond the classroom; it touches every part of my life and influences who I am.
        </br>       
            My name is Devansh Negi, and I come from the mystic lands of India. I am truly excited to contribute my knowledge and skills as a proud member of Team 2 (GDSD). I look forward to mutual growth with my talented and respected teammates.          
        </br> 
            By the end of this term, I hope to have not only meaningful memories with my team but also a rich project experience that we can all be proud of. Together, I believe we can accomplish great things. 
    </br>
            Hereâ€™s to a term filled with learning, respect, and teamwork. 
        </br> 
            <h4> Best of luck to us all! </h4>
